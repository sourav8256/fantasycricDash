# Command to get all devices connected on this network

# For Windows:
arp -a

# For macOS and Linux:
arp -a

# Note: These commands may require administrative privileges to run.
# They display the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache, which shows IP and MAC addresses of devices on the local network.

# For a more comprehensive scan on Linux, you can use:
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

# Replace 192.168.1.0/24 with your network's IP range if different.
# This requires nmap to be installed (sudo apt-get install nmap on Ubuntu/Debian).
