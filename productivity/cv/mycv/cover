I am writing to express my interest in the IT Operations position at your organization. With nearly 5 years of experience in application support and operations across leading companies like Northern Trust, Infosys, and Wipro, I bring a strong background in managing critical banking and healthcare applications.

In my current role at Northern Trust, I've implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and led incident management for banking applications, reducing resolution times by 30%. At Infosys, I managed critical P1/P2 incidents and reduced recurring issues by 40% through proactive monitoring and preventive measures. During my tenure at Wipro, I led an L2 support team handling complex healthcare application issues, demonstrating my ability to manage both technical challenges and team responsibilities.

My expertise spans IBM BPM, Appian, REST APIs, and SAP integrations, complemented by strong incident management and problem-solving skills. I am particularly skilled in implementing automated monitoring solutions and streamlining support procedures for improved operational efficiency.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my technical expertise and operational experience to your team. Thank you for considering my application.
