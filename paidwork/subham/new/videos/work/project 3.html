    <h3>This is one of my early days project in the field of content creation and animation at BYJU'S. 

        <p>The video is about fractions, a topic that many students find difficult and boring. The task was to make the video fun and easy to understand for 6th standard students.</p>
        
        To do that, I came up with a creative idea: using comic books as a way to explain fractions. I thought comic books would be a great way to connect with the students, as they are colorful, entertaining, and popular. 
        
        <p>Created the video from scratch, doing everything from the idea, storyboard, and artwork. I used After Effects for the animation and worked with a sound designer for the audio.</p> 
        
        The project took me 40 hours to finish, but it was a very rewarding and enjoyable experience. I learned a lot about fractions, comic books, and animation. I also developed my creative thinking and problem-solving skills from this project.
        
        Thank you for your attention!</h3>
