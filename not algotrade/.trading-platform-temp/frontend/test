/*
To access the current local host using another device on the same network, follow these steps:

1. Find the local IP address of the host machine:
   - On Windows:
     - Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`.
     - Look for the "IPv4 Address" under the active network connection.
   - On macOS/Linux:
     - Open Terminal and type `ifconfig` or `ip a`.
     - Look for the "inet" address under the active network connection.

2. Ensure that the host machine's firewall allows incoming connections on the desired port (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).

3. On the host machine, start the server (e.g., a web server) and ensure it is listening on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) or the specific local IP address.

4. On the other device, open a web browser and enter the local IP address of the host machine followed by the port number (if not using the default port 80). For example:
   ```
   http://192.168.1.100:8080
   ```

5. You should now be able to access the local host from the other device on the same network.
