    <h3>This is a project I completed for JOVES, where I had the opportunity to showcase my skills in animation and storytelling. ðŸŒŸ

      <P>Project Brief:
      The challenge was to create a short video on the topic of extraction. After extensive research, I embarked on this creative journey, aiming to simplify complex concepts through visual storytelling.</P>
      
      Storyboard Design:
      I meticulously crafted a storyboard, envisioning a 2D animated video that would captivate viewers. Each scene was carefully planned to convey the essence of extraction in an engaging and straightforward manner.
      
      <p> Elements:
      To bring my vision to life, I sourced elements from Freepik, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing aesthetic. From chemical processes to natural resources, every frame was meticulously designed.</p>
      
      Animation Magic:
      Using Adobe After Effects, I animated each scene, seamlessly transitioning from one concept to another. The power of animation lies in its ability to simplify intricate ideas, making them accessible to a wide audience.
      
      <p>Soundtrack Creation:
      The audio experience was equally important. I generated computerized audio to complement the visuals, enhancing the overall impact. The background music, lovingly crafted in Adobe Premiere Pro. </p>
      
      Time and Dedication:
      This project was a labor of love, consuming a total of 45 hours. But every second spent was worth itâ€”I take immense pride in how I distilled complex information into an engaging video.</h3>
